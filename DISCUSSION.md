# Next Steps!

## Must do:
- Add API Docs. Swagger, confluence, or any preferred.
- Configure application environments. (i.e develop, stage, production, etc.)

## Recommended:
- Add logger, so you don't rely on console logs.
- Add pre-commit hook to run the linter, build and tests.
- Add unit tests for the base UI components.
- Add UI tests for the search flow using Cypress or a similar tool.
- Add CI workflows to run checks mentioned in the previous items before allowing to merge a PR.
- Add pagination to the advocates table.

## Nice to have:
- Add responsive design to the home page
- Break down home table into more sub components such as the table header, body, etc.
- Containerize the application to create a complete Docker environment that can be launched with a single `docker-compose up` command.
